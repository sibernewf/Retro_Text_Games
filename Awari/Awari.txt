Awari:

Rules implemented:

On your turn, choose one of your 6 pits (1–6). Sow seeds counter-clockwise.

Capture: if your last seed lands in an opponent pit and that pit now has 2 or 3, you capture those; continue backwards capturing adjacent opponent pits with 2 or 3.

No-starve rule: a capture that would leave the opponent with no seeds at all is disallowed; in that case, no capture occurs.

Game ends when a player has no legal move; the other side collects remaining seeds. Highest total wins.

The computer uses a quick greedy+lookahead (depth 4) to choose moves.
