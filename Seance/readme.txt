Seance — Player Documentation
Overview

In Seance, you are participating in a mysterious ritual where spirits send messages through the computer. Letters appear on screen one by one. Your goal is to memorize the sequence and type it back exactly as it was shown. The spirits will grow angry if you make a mistake, and your séance will end.

Gameplay Rules

Each round, the spirits send you a new sequence of letters (length 4–7).

The sequence is displayed slowly, letter by letter.

You must type the letters back in order.

If correct:

The spirits are pleased.

Your score increases.

The next round begins.

If incorrect:

The spirits become angry.

A random haunting punishment occurs (table shaking, bulb shattering, cold hands).

The game ends, and your final score is displayed.

Tips

Pay close attention to the timing — letters appear quickly!

Practice memorizing in chunks (pairs or triplets of letters).

The longer you last, the harder it feels — but the spirits will reward your focus.

Ending

Escape with a high score by surviving multiple spirit messages.

One mistake, and the séance is over…
