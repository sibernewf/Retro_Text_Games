BOWL – Player Guide
📜 Overview
Bowl is a simulated ten-pin bowling game for 1–4 players.
The game plays 10 frames, with up to two rolls per frame (three in the 10th frame if you score a strike or spare).
Your goal: knock down as many pins as possible and score the highest total.

🕹 How to Play
The game will ask how many players (1–4).
Enter a number and press Enter.

The game begins with Frame 1, Ball 1 for Player 1.

When prompted:

Press Enter to roll

OR type roll and press Enter

The game will simulate your throw and display the pin diagram after each roll.

The game will print one of the following:

GUTTER – no pins knocked down

STRIKE – all 10 pins knocked down on the first ball

SPARE – all remaining pins knocked down on the second ball

ERROR – only possible if the roll result was invalid (shouldn’t happen in normal play)

Play passes to the next player and continues until all players have bowled 10 frames.

🎯 Pin Diagram
The computer uses the following ASCII display after each roll:
0 = Pin knocked down
+ = Pin still standing
    +  
   + +  
  + + +  
 + + + + 
 
Example after rolling a strike:
    0  
   0 0  
  0 0 0  
 0 0 0 0

📊 Scoring
Strike (X) = 10 + pins knocked down in next 2 rolls

Spare (/) = 10 + pins knocked down in next roll

Open Frame = total pins knocked down in that frame

The game automatically calculates and displays your final score at the end.

💡 Tips for Play
Consistency matters: Since rolls are random, every player has an equal chance.

Two-player mode is fast-paced and ideal for competition.

Three or four players makes for longer games but more fun in a group.

You don’t need to type “roll” every time – pressing Enter is faster.

A strike on the first ball means you skip the second roll for that frame.

If you get a strike or spare in the 10th frame, you get bonus rolls automatically.
