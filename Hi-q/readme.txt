Player Documentation ‚Äì Hi-Q (Peg Solitaire)
üéØ Objective
The goal of Hi-Q is to remove as many pegs as possible from the board.
You start with a cross-shaped pegboard filled with pegs, except for the center hole.
You remove pegs by "jumping" one peg over another into an empty hole ‚Äî the jumped peg is removed.

A perfect game removes all 32 pegs, leaving only the last peg on the board.

üïπ How to Play
Game Start

The board is displayed with peg positions labeled by numbers.

Peg numbers are shown for reference only ‚Äî these are the positions you'll use to make moves.

Making a Move

You will be asked:

"MOVE WHICH PIECE?" ‚Üí Enter the number of the peg you want to move.

"TO WHERE?" ‚Üí Enter the destination hole number.

Your move must be legal:

You can only jump over one peg into an empty space.

The jumped-over peg will be removed.

Jumps can be horizontal or vertical, but not diagonal.

Illegal Moves

If you try an invalid move (e.g., jumping into an occupied space, not jumping exactly two positions, etc.), the game will tell you "ILLEGAL MOVE, TRY AGAIN" and you will be prompted to retry.

Game Progress

After each move, the board will be displayed with updated peg positions.

Continue making moves until no legal moves remain.

Game End

When no legal moves remain, the game displays:

"GAME IS OVER"

How many pegs remain on the board.

Your final score.

If you removed all pegs except one, you achieved a Perfect Score!

| `PLAY AGAIN (YES OR NO)` | Type `YES` to restart, or `NO` to quit   |

üèÜ Scoring
Perfect Game: Only 1 peg left = maximum skill.

Good Game: 2‚Äì5 pegs left.

Try Again: More than 5 pegs left ‚Äî see if you can do better next time.

üí° Tips & Strategy
Always try to keep moves toward the center of the board to open up more options.

Avoid isolating pegs ‚Äî if a peg is surrounded and cannot jump, it becomes stuck.

Plan multiple moves ahead rather than focusing only on immediate jumps.
