CAN-AM — Player Guide
Canadian-American Challenge Cup auto race (single-terminal edition)

To play, double-click run.bat in the game’s folder.
This builds and runs the game, then keeps the window open when the race ends.

Goal
Finish the full road-course faster than your opponents. Manage speed, grip, weather, and hazards; avoid wipe-outs; use drafting to your advantage.

What’s on the Track
Course: ~5.3 miles, 16 sections (straights & curves), each with a posted max speed and length.

Cars / Drivers: Each has a random adhesion factor (grip; lower = better) and a small car strength offset.

Hazards:

Rain may come and go → reduces grip, raises crash risk.

Oil accumulates after incidents and lingers (especially in curves) → slippery!

Drafting: Finish a section ≤ 1.0 s behind a car and you’ll gain a small time credit on the next section.

Setup
Choose number of drivers (1–8).

Choose how many human drivers (0–8).

Enter the names for human drivers. Auto-pilot names are supplied.

The game prints each driver’s adhesion (grip) and carΔ (small mph bonus/penalty).

Controls (per section)
For each driver in running order:

You see: section name, type (Straight/Curve), length, posted max, and your estimated safe speed.

Type a target speed (mph) for this section.

Press Enter to repeat your last speed.

Type Q at any prompt to quit immediately.

Auto-pilots pick speeds themselves (conservative / steady / brave tendencies).

How Speeds Work
Your time for the section is computed from length / speed, with drafting credit applied if eligible.

If you exceed your safe speed, your wipe-out probability rises (more on curves, in rain/oil, and with poor adhesion).

If you wipe → DNF (you’re out), and you may make the oil situation worse for others.

Finish & Results
After all 16 sections:

Standings are printed (alive drivers ordered by total time; DNFs listed after).

A full play-by-play is saved to canam_results.txt in the game folder.

Tips
Respect curves. Even with high adhesion, curves punish over-speed—especially in rain or oil.

Posted max ≠ safe speed. Safe speed is adjusted for your grip, weather, and car; heed the “safe≈” hint.

Think in sections. Use a little margin early; push straights harder than curves.

Draft smart. If you’re close to the car ahead, that next-section credit is free time.

Stay alive. A cautious lap that finishes beats a brave one that ends in the marbles.

Quick Reference (During a Turn)
Prompt shows: Driver — Section (safe≈X, max Y) mph:

Enter → repeat your last speed

Number → set that speed for this section

Q → quit the race
