Gomoko – Player Guide (Basic Version)
Overview
Gomoko is a traditional five-in-a-row game from the Orient.
Two players — you (X) and the computer (O) — take turns placing markers on the board.
The first to get five consecutive markers horizontally, vertically, or diagonally wins.

This basic version is simpler than GomokoPlus:

The computer does not try to block you.

The program does not detect a win — you must watch the board and decide when to stop.

Game Start
The board starts empty.

You play first as X.

Board Layout
Default is a 19 × 19 grid of dots (.) showing empty intersections.

Numbers across the top and left edges help identify positions.

Example (small section):
    1  2  3  4  5
 1  .  .  .  .  .
 2  .  .  .  .  .
 3  .  .  .  .  .

Controls
Placing a Marker

On your turn, type the row number and then the column number.
Example: entering 8 12 puts your X at row 8, column 12.

Quitting

There is no dedicated quit command — you can just end the program (e.g., press Ctrl+C).

Rules
You play X, the computer plays O.

Players alternate turns.

You cannot place a marker where one already exists.

The computer moves randomly — it does not block or set up winning strategies.

The program will not tell you who wins — you must keep track yourself.

Ending the Game
Since win detection is missing, you must decide when someone has won.

Typically, the game ends when:

You spot five-in-a-row for yourself or the computer.

The board is full.

Example Turn:

Enter your move (row col): 10 10
You placed X at (10,10).
Computer placed O at (4,7).

Tips
The computer is easy to beat — it moves randomly.

Plan ahead and aim for open lines.

Since the game won’t tell you when you’ve won, double-check the board each turn.
