Here’s a clean C# console version that asks for width and height, generates a perfect maze, and prints it as ASCII.
How to run it
Option A — .NET CLI (recommended)
Install the .NET SDK if needed: dotnet.microsoft.com/download

In a terminal:

dotnet new console -n Amazin
cd Amazin
# Replace Program.cs with the code above (or name the file Amazin.cs and update csproj if you prefer)
dotnet run
When prompted, enter width and height (e.g. 39 7), and it will print the maze.

Option B — Unity
Create a new C# script named Amazin.cs, paste the code, and change Main() to Start() inside a MonoBehaviour that logs to a UI Text or writes to a file—console output is awkward in-editor. For a quick play experience, the pure .NET console route is much nicer.
