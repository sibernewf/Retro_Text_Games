Battle of Numbers — Player Guide
Overview
Battle of Numbers is a classic take-away strategy game.
You and the computer take turns removing objects from a single pile.
The game can be played with two different winning conditions, and you can customise the pile size, allowed moves, and who plays first.

Starting the Game
Run the game using your batch file:

run.bat
(This runs dotnet run for you — no extra steps required.)

The game will display a welcome message and guide you through the setup.

Game Setup Options
When prompted, enter each value and press Enter.

Pile Size –
Total number of objects to start with.
Must be at least 1.

Win Option –
1 = Take the last object to win (normal play)
2 = Avoid taking the last object to win (misère play)

Minimum Take –
The fewest objects you can remove on a turn (minimum 1).

Maximum Take –
The most objects you can remove on a turn.
Must be equal to or greater than your minimum take.

Start Option –
1 = Computer moves first
2 = You move first

Taking Your Turn
On your turn, type how many objects you want to take and press Enter.

You must take at least the minimum allowed and no more than the maximum allowed, unless there are fewer objects left — in which case you may take all remaining.

If you try an illegal move, you will be prompted to try again.

Ending the Game
The game ends when there are no objects left in the pile:

Win Option 1: The player who took the last object wins.

Win Option 2: The player who took the last object loses.

The game will announce the result, then ask:

PLAY AGAIN (Y/N)?
Press Y to start a new game with new settings.

Press N to return to the desktop.

Quitting at Any Time
You can type:

Q
at any prompt to immediately quit the game.

Tips for Winning
In Option 1 (take last wins), aim to leave the pile in a position where:

pile % (min + max) ∈ {0 .. min-1}
In Option 2 (take last loses), try to leave:

pile % (min + max) ∈ {1 .. min}
Watch the computer’s moves — it plays with an optimal strategy.
