📘 Player Documentation – 23MTCH: Game of 23 Matches
🎮 The Rules

There are 23 matches on the table.

You and the computer take turns removing matches.

On your turn, you must take 1, 2, or 3 matches.

The player who is forced to take the last match loses.

🕹️ How to Play

At the start of the game you see:

There are now 23 matches.
How many do you take? (1–3):


Enter 1, 2, or 3.

The computer then takes its turn, and the game continues.

If you take the last match, you lose.

If the computer takes the last match, you win!

📋 Example Game
There are now 23 matches.
How many do you take? 3
I took 1 ... there are now 19 matches.

There are now 19 matches.
How many do you take? 2
I took 2 ... there are now 15 matches.

🏆 Winning Strategy

The secret: leave the computer a multiple of 4 after your turn.

From 23, your winning first move is to take 3 matches (leaving 20).

After that, whatever the computer takes, you take enough to make the total removed equal 4.

If you follow this, you’ll force the computer to take the last match.
