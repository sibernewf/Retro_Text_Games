Player Documentation — Submarine
Overview
You’re the submarine; the computer is the gunboat. The gunboat is somewhere a few thousand yards away and moving fast. You pick a firing angle (0–359°) for your torpedo; it runs straight forever at a fixed speed. If your torpedo’s path passes within ~100 yards of the gunboat, you score a HIT and win. Miss four times and the gunboat finds you and… well… gloub gloub.

How to Play
To play, double-click run.bat in the game’s folder.
This will build and run the game, and keep the window open when it finishes.

Controls
When prompted, type a firing angle like 73 and press Enter.

You get 4 torpedoes per encounter.

After a miss, we show your closest approach in yards so you can adjust.

After each encounter, choose to play again.

Press Q at any prompt to quit immediately.

What the Game Tells You
Initial intel: current range estimate and a rough angle band (“try between 42° and 87°”) to help first shots.

After each shot:

HIT → “DIRECT HIT! THE GUNBOAT IS SUNK.”

MISS → “SPLASH — MISS. CLOSEST APPROACH ≈ N yards.”

Notes
Units: yards for distance, minutes for time. Torpedo speed is 50 kts; gunboat speed varies 12–32 kts on a random course.

A session log is saved to submarine_log.txt (angles, hits, misses).

The sub is fixed at the origin; the gunboat moves in a straight line — so your best plan is to lead the target.
