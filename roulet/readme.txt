ROULET â€” European Roulette (Single Zero)

This is a console version of European Roulette (single zero), inspired by the BASIC game in 101 BASIC Computer Games.
You can place one or more types of bets on each spin:

ðŸ’¡ Tips for Players

Zero (green) is neither odd/even nor red/black, and belongs to no column â€” itâ€™s the house edge.

You can bet on multiple categories to hedge risks.

Manage your bankroll â€” big bets on single numbers can pay huge, but have low odds.

ðŸ”§ Troubleshooting

Game wonâ€™t run:

Make sure you have the correct .NET Runtime/SDK installed.

Run from a terminal, not by double-clicking the .cs file.

Invalid input:

For YES/NO questions, type YES or NO.

For numeric bets, only whole dollar amounts between 1 and 10,000 are accepted.
