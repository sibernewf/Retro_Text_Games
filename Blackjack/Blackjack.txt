Player Documentation — Modern Blackjack
Overview
A streamlined Vegas-style blackjack in the console. You start with a bankroll, place wagers, and play against the dealer. Dealer stands on all 17s. A natural blackjack pays 3:2. You can double down on your first decision; insurance is offered when the dealer shows an Ace.

How to Play
To play, double-click run.bat in the game’s folder.
This will build and run the game, and keep the window open when it finishes.

Type numbers for bankroll and wagers.

During a hand, choose:

H – Hit

S – Stand

D – Double down (only as your first decision; exactly one card)

When the dealer shows an Ace, you may buy Insurance (pays 2:1 if the dealer has blackjack).

Press Q at any prompt to quit immediately.

Rules Recap
Card values: 2–10 face value; J/Q/K = 10; A = 1 or 11.

Blackjack: an Ace + 10-value card as your first two cards.

Dealer: hits until 17 or more; stands on soft 17 (A+6) in this version.

Outcomes:

Win → you win what you bet (even money).

Blackjack → pays 3:2 (e.g., bet $20 → win $30).

Loss → you lose your bet.

Push → no money changes hands.

Insurance → optional half-bet if dealer shows Ace; pays 2:1 only if dealer has blackjack.
