LETTER — Letter Guessing Game
Overview
The computer secretly chooses a random letter of the alphabet (A–Z).
Your job: Guess the letter in as few tries as possible.

After each guess, the computer tells you whether your guess is too high or too low in the alphabet.
It should not take you more than 5 guesses to find the letter.

How to Play
The computer picks a random letter.

You make a guess by typing any letter A–Z and pressing Enter.

The computer responds with:

"TOO LOW. TRY A HIGHER LETTER."

"TOO HIGH. TRY A LOWER LETTER."

Keep guessing until you find the mystery letter.

The computer will tell you how many guesses you took and give you feedback.

Winning
Guess the correct letter, e.g.:

YOU GOT IT IN 3 GUESSES!!
GOOD JOB !!!
Tips
Use alphabetical ordering to narrow down the search.

Start near the middle (like M or N) to find the letter faster.

Each guess should cut the possible range in half (binary search strategy).
