Subway Scavenger — Player Guide
Quick Start

To play, double-click run.bat in the game’s folder.
This will build and run the game and keep the window open when it finishes.

Alternatively:

Windows: open a terminal in the project folder and run dotnet run.

macOS/Linux: use a terminal and run dotnet run (requires .NET installed).

Premise

You’re a courier in New York City. Your boss has given you five deliveries and five pickups (15 total locations). You’ll ride the subway, walk blocks, and manage your time and money. The workday ends at 5:00 pm (or 6:00 pm if you pick easier mode). Any unused token money is yours to keep!

Game Flow

Introduction
Choose whether deliveries are allowed until 6:00 pm (easier mode).

Logbook
You’ll be given 10 package entries (deliveries & pickups). Copy or print this screen — it’s your reference.

Starting Out
You begin at 42 St / 8 Av subway station with $20 for tokens.

At a Station

View which trains stop here.

If you’re on foot, you may need to buy tokens.

Choose whether to:

Pick up (P) a package

Deliver (D) a package

Check logbook (C)

Get another train (T)

Train Travel

A train arrives randomly; board it or wait.

Each train has two directions (north/west vs south/east).

Hazards may occur: stuck doors, unsavory characters, even fires on the tracks.

Pickups/Deliveries

Select by logbook number.

If you’re at the right station, walk the indicated number of blocks.

Deliveries free up log slots; pickups add new packages to the log.

Time System

The clock advances with walking, waiting, train rides, or delays.

At noon, you’ll stop for lunch (unless you’re on a train).

After 5:00 pm (or 6:00 pm in easy mode), offices close — unfinished work ends the game.

Ending

Win: complete all 15 tasks before time runs out.

Lose: run out of time, cash, or give up.

A summary shows your deliveries, logbook status, and token use.

Controls

Prompts: type your answer and press Enter.

Yes/No: enter Y or N (empty input defaults to Y).

Menu Choices: type the letter shown (P, D, C, T).

Logbook/Station numbers: enter the numeric index given.

Tips

Copy or print your logbook screen at the start — you’ll need it.

Remember: pickups add new packages, so your log grows.

Buying too many tokens wastes your limited budget.

Hazards are random — sometimes it’s best to wait or switch trains.

Plan station choices carefully; walking long distances wastes time.

System Requirements

Windows, macOS, or Linux.

A recent .NET runtime if running via dotnet run.

Console/terminal capable of plain ASCII output.
