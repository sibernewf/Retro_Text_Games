Winning the Game

📊 Scoring & Strategy
Slap Shot – Best for when you need raw power to get past the goalie.

Flick Shot – Use for quick plays or when close to the net.

Wrist Shot – Best for precision shooting; often the safest choice.

Watch out for goalie saves and defensive rebounds — possession can change quickly.

Avoid penalties, as Cornell can take advantage when you’re short-handed.

💡 Tips for Success
Mix up your shots to keep the goalie guessing.

Pay attention to how Cornell responds — adapt your play style.

In sudden death, accuracy is more important than power.

Stay alert for rebounds and puck turnovers.
