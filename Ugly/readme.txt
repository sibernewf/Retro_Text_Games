📘 Player Documentation – UGLY: Draws an Ugly Woman
🎮 The Program

UGLY is a light-hearted ASCII art drawing program from the early EduSystem era.
It draws a side profile of a “woman” on your terminal, using X’s to form the head, face, and shoulders.
You can either:

CHANCE → Let the computer pick the figure’s “dimensions” randomly.

SPECIAL → Enter your own values for the three “dimensions” (A, B, C).

The results vary, sometimes looking graceful… sometimes less so. The computer may even call your drawing UGLY!

🕹️ How to Play

When the program starts, it asks:

DO YOU WANT CHANCE(1), OR SPECIAL(2)?


Enter 1 to let the computer choose random proportions.

Enter 2 to type your own values.

If you choose CHANCE, the program will show you the random numbers it picked.

You can accept them, or type 2 to decline and instead enter your own SPECIAL values.

If you choose SPECIAL, you’ll be asked:

WHAT ARE YOUR VALUES FOR A, B, AND C?


Enter three integers.

These numbers change the shape of the profile:

A – head height / crown

B – face length

C – nose / lips / chin emphasis

The program then prints the figure line by line using ASCII Xs.

📋 Example Run
PROGRAM 'UGLY'

DO YOU WANT CHANCE(1), OR SPECIAL(2)? 1
A = 21   B = 46   C = 18
DO YOU STILL WANT CHANCE -- 1 FOR YES, 2 FOR NO? 1

        XXX
       XXXXX
        XX
        XX
XXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXX
XXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXX
        XX
       XXXX
        XX
        XX
        XX
       XXXX


If the proportions are odd, you may see the program spam “UGLY! UGLY! UGLY!” across the screen.

🏆 Objective

There is no score or win condition — the fun is in experimenting with different numbers and seeing what the computer draws.

Try both CHANCE and SPECIAL to compare results.

See if you can find values that produce something you actually think looks beautiful instead of UGLY!
