Player Documentation — BATTLE
Overview
BATTLE is a quick, text-based “Battleship” variant. The enemy fleet is hidden on a 10×10 grid. Fire at coordinates to score DIRECT HITS and sink ships. We track your SPLASH/HIT ratio and report how many Destroyers, Cruisers, and Carriers you’ve sunk.

How to Play (with your setup)
To play, double-click run.bat in the game’s folder.
This will build and run the game, and keep the window open when it finishes.

Controls
Enter a coordinate as row,column (e.g., 5,2) or as letter+number (e.g., C7, A10).

Q → quit immediately.

What you’ll see
SPLASH! TRY AGAIN. → Miss.

A DIRECT HIT ON SHIP NUMBER N. → You’ve hit ship N.

…AND YOU SINK IT. HURRAH FOR THE GOOD GUYS. → Ship N sunk. We’ll list class losses so far.

YOUR CURRENT SPLASH/HIT RATIO IS X. → Misses per hit. Lower is better.

Win condition
Sink all ships to win. When you’re done, a log of the session is saved to:

  battle_playbyplay.txt

Tips
Shots you repeat are ignored (we’ll remind you you’ve already fired there).

Carriers are the longest targets; once you find a segment, probe in straight lines.
