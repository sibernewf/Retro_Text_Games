BULCOW — Player Guide
(Bulls & Cows — 5-Digit Number Guessing Game)

Objective
Be the first to correctly guess your opponent’s secret 5-digit number (all digits different, first digit 1–9).
You and the computer will take turns guessing each other’s number.
The first to get 5 Bulls wins.

Game Rules
Secrets

Each player secretly chooses a 5-digit number.

Digits must be unique.

The first digit cannot be 0.

Example: 53917 ✅, 05512 ❌.

Turns

You and the computer alternate guesses.

After each guess, the program will give a score:

BULL → Correct digit in the correct position.

COW → Correct digit but in the wrong position.

Example:

Secret: 53917

Guess: 53192

5 ✅ (Bull, right place)

3 ✅ (Bull, right place)

1 ✅ (Cow, wrong place)
Score: 2 Bulls, 1 Cow.

Winning

First to 5 Bulls wins.

If you guess the computer’s secret first → You Win!

If the computer guesses yours first → Computer Wins!

Commands
At the start: Enter your secret number when prompted. The computer also secretly chooses one.

During your turn:

Enter your guess directly (e.g., 48213).

Q → Quit the game anytime.

No need to score the computer’s guesses yourself — the program does it automatically.

Example Turn
— TURN 3 —
Your guess: 48213
You score: 1 BULL and 2 COWS.

Computer guesses: 53917
Computer scores: 3 BULLS and 0 COWS.
Candidates remaining for the computer: 27

Tips for Winning
Start broad: Choose guesses that cover many different digits to quickly rule out numbers.

Track feedback:

Bulls tell you the exact positions you’ve nailed.

Cows tell you the digit exists but is misplaced.

Eliminate systematically: Each score lets you cross off impossible numbers.

Avoid repeating digits you already know aren’t in the secret.

Watch the candidates remaining count for the computer — if it’s dropping fast, speed up your search!
