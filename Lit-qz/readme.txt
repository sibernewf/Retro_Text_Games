LITQZ — Children's Literature Quiz
Overview
LITQZ is a short, lighthearted multiple-choice quiz testing your knowledge of characters, settings, and trivia from well-known children’s stories.

It asks four questions in sequence. Each question has four possible answers, numbered 1–4.

You type the number of your choice, press Enter, and the program tells you if you are correct or not. After all four questions, you get a little “verdict” on your nursery-rhyme and children’s literature skills.
