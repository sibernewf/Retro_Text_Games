ðŸ›  How to Run These Games

These BASIC conversions are plain C# console programs.
To run one:

1. Install .NET SDK
- Download and install the latest .NET SDK
 - (Any reasonably recent version, e.g. .NET 6, 7, or 8, will work.)

2. Create a New Console Project
 - Open a terminal/command prompt and run:

  dotnet new console -n GameName
  cd GameName

This creates a new folder GameName/ with a console project inside.

3. Replace the Template Code
 - Delete the auto-generated Program.cs and copy in the gameâ€™s Program.cs from this repository:
 - Each program contains a readme.txt providing player instructions.

 del Program.cs        # Windows PowerShell
 rm Program.cs         # macOS/Linux

Then copy in the provided Program.cs.

4. Run the Game
From the project folder:

  dotnet run

The game will build and launch in the terminal.
