🌀 Player Documentation – ZOOP
📝 What is ZOOP?

ZOOP isn’t a real programming tool—it’s a parody of a BASIC compiler.
Instead of executing your commands, it twists them into nonsense or sarcastic replies.

It was originally written to frustrate BASIC programmers by mocking the commands they typed in.

🎮 How to Play

Launch the program by running run.bat.

You’ll see:

READY
(Type commands like CAT, SCRATCH, PRINT… only the first two letters matter.)
(Type BYE or press Enter to quit.)


Type any “system command” or BASIC word.

Only the first two letters of what you type matter.

ZOOP replies with a funny or confusing response.

Keep typing new commands until you’re ready to stop.

Type BYE (or press Enter) to quit.

You’ll see:

WIPED OUT COMPLETELY!!!

Think of it as an inside joke for programmers.
