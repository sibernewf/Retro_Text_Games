BANNER PRINTS A LARGE BANNER
Description
This program creates a large banner on a terminal of any
message you input (up to 54 characters in length). The
letters may be any dimension you wish although the letter
height plus distance from left-hand side should not exceed
6 inches. Also, the letter height should be somewhat more
than the width. Adhering to these rules will generally produce
a very attractive banner.
computer Limitations
BANNER was written for a DIGITAL EduSystem 50. For other
computers, the character string line input (LINPUT) statement
at Line 240 would have to be changed.

Banner Printer – Player Documentation
Overview
The Banner Printer program creates large “poster-style” text using block letters.
You choose:
 - The height and width of the letters (in inches)
 - How far from the left margin to start printing
 - The message you want in big letters

The program prints your message in the console and saves it to a text file (banner_output.txt) so you can view or print it later.

Starting the Program
 - Open the program from your terminal or command prompt.
 - Follow the on-screen prompts to enter:
   - Letter height and width (in inches)
   - Left margin (in inches from the left edge)
   - Your message text

Example start in terminal:

  dotnet run

Alternately
  double click on Run.bat

Step-by-Step Instructions
1. Enter Letter Height and Width
You’ll see:
  INPUT HEIGHT, WIDTH IN INCHES?

 - Type two numbers separated by a comma or space.
 - Example:
    4 3

This means each letter is 4 inches tall and 3 inches wide.

2. Enter Left Margin
You’ll see:
  HOW FAR IN INCHES FROM THE LEFT HAND SIDE, DO YOU WANT TO PLACE THE LETTERS?

 -- Enter a number for the left margin in inches.
 - Example:
    2

This indents the text 2 inches from the left edge.

3. Enter Your Message
You’ll see:
  INPUT MESSAGE HERE
  >

 - Type your message in letters A–Z (numbers and punctuation can be added in a future update).
 - Example:
    HELLO WORLD

4. View the Output
The program:
 - Displays the banner immediately in the console.
 - Saves the same banner to banner_output.txt in the program’s folder.

You’ll see:

  Banner saved to: C:\path\to\your\project\banner_output.txt

Opening the Saved Banner
 - Go to the program folder.
 - Find the file banner_output.txt.
 - Open it with Notepad, TextEdit, or any text viewer.
 - You can now print it on a normal printer or paste it into documents.

Tips & Notes
 - Bigger width/height = more scaling of each letter.
 - The program replaces the “ink” in each letter with the letter itself, so it looks bold and readable.
 - Messages print in uppercase automatically.
 - If your console window is narrow, lines may wrap — check the banner_output.txt file for correct layout.

Example Run
  INPUT HEIGHT, WIDTH IN INCHES? 4 3
  HOW FAR IN INCHES FROM THE LEFT HAND SIDE, DO YOU WANT TO PLACE THE LETTERS? 1
  INPUT MESSAGE HERE
  > BANNER TEST

Banner saved to: C:\Users\You\BannerPrinter\banner_output.txt

The output file will contain large block letters spelling BANNER TEST starting 1 inch from the left margin.
