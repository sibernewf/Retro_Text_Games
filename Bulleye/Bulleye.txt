Game Overview
Bulleye is a multiplayer dart-throwing game for 1–20 players, where the goal is to score 200 points before your opponents.
You’ll take turns choosing a throwing style, each with its own risk and reward. The first player (or players) to reach 200 points wins.

Objective
Be the first to score 200 points by hitting higher-value zones on the dartboard.

How to Play
Enter the number of players (1–20).

Enter each player’s name (press Enter for default name).

On your turn, choose your throw style:

1 = Fast Overarm – High risk, high reward. Likely either 40 points (bullseye) or 0 points.

2 = Controlled Overarm – Balanced risk. Often lands 10–30 points, occasional miss.

3 = Underarm – More consistent, can score anywhere from 0–40 points, weighted toward middle scores.

Press Enter without typing a number to repeat your last throw.

The game announces your score after each throw and updates your total.

Play continues in rounds until one or more players reach 200 points.

Winners are announced; ties are possible if multiple players hit 200 in the same round.

Scoring Zones
| Zone        | Points | Typical Throw Styles         |
| ----------- | ------ | ---------------------------- |
| Bullseye    | 40     | Fast Overarm, Underarm       |

Tips & Strategy
Fast Overarm is risky — use it if you’re trailing and need big points fast.

Controlled Overarm is good for steady scoring without too much risk.

Underarm gives the most varied results but avoids frequent total misses.

Remember: Press Enter to quickly repeat your last throw without retyping the number.
