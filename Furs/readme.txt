FURS: Fur Trading Expedition

📜 Premise
You are the leader of a French fur trading expedition in 1776, leaving the Lake Ontario region to sell furs and purchase supplies for the next year. You can trade at one of three forts, each with different prices, risks, and supply costs. Your success depends on your choices, luck, and managing your resources wisely.

🎯 Objective
Earn as much money as possible by trading different types of furs.

Choose trading locations strategically to maximize profit and minimize risk.

Continue trading year after year — or retire when you feel satisfied (or bankrupt).

🕹️ How to Play
Starting the Game
 - You begin with $50 in savings and 190 furs to trade.
 - Furs are divided randomly among Mink, Beaver, Ermine, and Fox pelts.

Trading Your Furs
 - You will be asked:

  DO YOU WISH TO TRADE FURS?
  ANSWER YES OR NO

 - YES: Continue the trading expedition.
 - NO: End the game and keep your current savings.

Choosing a Fort
You must choose where to trade:
 - Fort 1: Hochelaga (Montreal) – Protected by French army, safest route, low cost for supplies, but average sale prices.
 - Fort 2: Stadacona (Quebec) – Protected by French army, higher supply costs, average sale prices.
 - Fort 3: New York (Dutch control) – Highest possible prices, but most dangerous route (must cross Iroquois land).

Route Outcomes
 - Safe arrival: Sell furs at local market prices and buy supplies.
 - Risk events: Canoe accidents, theft, damage to furs, raids by the Iroquois, or being forced to abandon cargo.

Selling Furs
 - Each type of pelt sells at a different rate depending on the fort and market conditions.
 - Damaged furs fetch lower prices.
 - Poorly cured furs cannot be sold.

Buying Supplies
 - After trading, you must pay for yearly supplies at rates set by the fort.
 - Your net profit = Fur sales – supply costs.

Continuing the Game
 - After each trading round, you are asked:

  DO YOU WANT TO TRADE FURS NEXT YEAR?
  ANSWER YES OR NO

 - YES: Begin another year with new furs and your current savings.
 - NO: End the game and keep your total wealth.

⌨️ Available Commands / Inputs

⚠️ Special Rules & Events
