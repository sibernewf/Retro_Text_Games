Acey Deucy is a perfect little console game.
Here’s a clean C# version you can paste straight into a .NET console app (or drop into Unity as a quick test via the Console). I used the common house rules:
 - Two cards are dealt face-up (2–10, J, Q, K, A where A=14).
 - You bet that the 3rd card will fall strictly between the two.
 - If it’s between → you win your bet.
 - If it matches either end → you lose double your bet.
 - Otherwise → you lose your bet.
 - Start bankroll = 100. Bet 0 to skip (“chicken!”). Quit with Q.

How to run it (two easy ways)
Option A — .NET on your PC
 - Install .NET SDK (if you don’t have it): https://dotnet.microsoft.com/download
 - In a terminal:

  dotnet new console -n AceyDeucy
  cd AceyDeucy

 - Replace the generated Program.cs with the code above.
 - Run it:

  dotnet run

Option B — Unity (play in the Console)
 - Create an empty GameObject in a scene.
 - Add a new C# script AceyDeucy.cs and paste the same code, but wrap Main() with a quick launcher:
   - Change class Program to public class AceyDeucy : UnityEngine.MonoBehaviour
   - In Start(), call a coroutine that runs the loop and uses Debug.Log and UnityEditor.ConsoleWindow is clunky—so console play is better in .NET.
     (TL;DR: this one’s much nicer as a terminal game.)
