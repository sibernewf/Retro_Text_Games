CIVIL WAR – Player Documentation
Goal
Win as many battles as possible across a campaign of 14 historical engagements. You command the Confederacy. After each battle, your casualties are compared to the actual historical casualties and you’re told whether you won or lost that battle.

How to Play

Start the game and choose whether to view descriptions (rules).

For each battle you’ll see the situation: manpower, money, and inflation for both sides.

Choose your defensive strategy, then your offensive strategy:

(1) Artillery attack

(2) Frontal attack

(3) Flanking maneuvers

(4) Encirclement
(In this remake, 1–2 skew offensive, 3–4 skew defensive.)

Allocate your budget (Confederacy only):

Food

Salaries

Ammunition

The game computes casualties and desertions for both sides and tells you if you won or lost. It also tells you whether your casualties were more than / less than / the same as the historical record for that battle.

Your wins and losses are tallied across the whole campaign. At the end, you’ll be told which side wins the war.

Hints

Food and salaries mainly reduce desertions.

Ammunition impacts casualties (your firepower).

Aggressive strategies (1–2) can win battles but may cost more men if you underfund ammunition.

High inflation eats away at your effectiveness; you may need to spend more to keep parity.

Log File
Each run creates a transcript:
CIVILWAR_SampleRun_YYYYMMDD_HHMMSS.txt
It includes the setup, your choices, and results of every battle.

What’s included / how it plays
14 battles with reasonable, self-consistent anchors (not strict historical sources).

You choose Defensive and Offensive strategies (1–4) and allocate Food / Salaries / Ammunition for the Confederacy each battle.

The Union uses a simple AI to set its budgets.

The game calculates casualties and desertions for both sides, compares your CSA casualties to the historical anchor, and reports win/lose for each battle.

At the end, it declares who won the war based on your results.

A transcript is saved as CIVILWAR_SampleRun_YYYYMMDD_HHMMSS.txt.

Player doco (short form)
Goal: Win as many battles as you can as the Confederacy.

Steps per battle:

Pick DEFENSIVE strategy (1–4).

Pick OFFENSIVE strategy (1–4).

Allocate your budget (Food, Salaries, Ammunition).

Review results: casualties, desertions, win/lose, historical comparison.

Tips: Food & Salaries ↓desertions; Ammunition ↓your casualties (↑firepower).
Offensive choices can win ground but tend to bleed more, especially if ammo is underfunded.
Inflation hurts efficiency.
