NUMBER — Random Number Game

Goal:
Start with 100 points and reach 500 points before you run out of luck.

🎯 How to Play

The computer secretly picks a number between 1 and 5.

You guess a number from 1 to 5.

You gain or lose points depending on how close your guess is to the secret number:

Exact match (distance 0): +20 points

Off by 1: +10 points

Off by 2: 0 points

Off by 3: –10 points

Off by 4: –20 points

Occasionally, you’ll hit a JACKPOT 🎰 — your total score is doubled instantly.

Play continues until you reach 500 points — then you win! 🏆

💡 Tips & Strategy

Guessing randomly can work, but tracking the distribution of previous numbers may improve your odds.

Hitting a jackpot early can speed up the win, but don’t rely on it — focus on consistent positive gains.

Being off by 2 costs you nothing, so sometimes aiming near the middle values (e.g., 3) can reduce risk.

📌 Commands / Input

Guess: Type a number from 1 to 5 when prompted.

Play Again: After winning, type Y for yes or N for no.

🏆 Winning

You win the moment your score reaches 500 points or more. The computer announces your total.
