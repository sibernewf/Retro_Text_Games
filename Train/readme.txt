📘 Player Documentation – TRAIN: Time–Speed–Distance Quiz
🎮 The Quiz

This program teaches the classic distance = rate × time relationship using randomized car vs. train word problems.

Problem Format

The program generates a statement like:

A CAR TRAVELING 44 MPH CAN MAKE A CERTAIN TRIP IN
14 HOURS LESS THAN A TRAIN TRAVELING AT 24 MPH.
HOW LONG DOES THE TRIP TAKE BY CAR?


You type in your answer (time in hours).

Feedback

If your answer is within 5% of the correct value → GOOD!.

If your answer is outside that range → SORRY. YOU WERE OFF BY X%.

The program then prints the correct answer.

Play Cycle

A random car speed, train speed, and time difference are chosen.

You solve the problem and enter your answer.

The program checks your response and shows feedback.

You are asked: ANOTHER PROBLEM (YES OR NO)?

YES → get a new problem.

NO → quit.

🏆 Objective

Practice solving time–speed–distance problems until you can consistently answer within 5%.
