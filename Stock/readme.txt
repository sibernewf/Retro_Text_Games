📘 Player Documentation – Stock Play: The Stock Market
🎮 How to Play

At the start, you are given $10,000 cash.

Each trading day, you see a stock table:

Stock symbol (IBM, RCA, LGB, ABC, CBS)

Price per share

Your holdings (shares owned)

Current value of holdings

Net price change from yesterday

You will then be prompted for transactions:

Enter a positive number to buy that many shares.

Enter a negative number to sell that many shares.

Enter 0 to do nothing.

All transactions have a 1% brokerage fee (deducted from your cash).

📈 Market Behavior

Stock prices are driven by randomized trends:

Each stock has a hidden upward or downward drift.

Trends last several days, then may change direction.

Prices can rise, fall, or even hit zero — but may rebound later.

The New York Stock Exchange Average is shown each day, with its Net Change compared to the previous day.

💰 Assets & Portfolio

After each day, your portfolio summary is shown:

Total Stock Assets = sum of your shares × current prices.

Total Cash Assets = remaining uninvested cash.

Total Assets = Stock Assets + Cash Assets.

🏦 Game Rules

You cannot buy more than your available cash.

You cannot sell more shares than you own.

Brokerage fee = 1% of the transaction value.

Even if a stock hits zero, you still “own” those shares (they may recover).

🕹️ Ending the Game

After each day, you are asked:
“Do you wish to continue? (YES=1, NO=0)”

Choose NO (0) to quit.

The game ends with your final portfolio value.

📋 Quick Tips

Diversify! Don’t put all your money in one stock.

Watch for trends — if a stock rises for several days, it may continue.

Selling at the right time can lock in profits before a downturn.

Try to survive at least 10 days to get a real feel for the market.
