📘 Player Documentation – The Journey of Marco Polo, 1271
🎮 The Goal

Travel 6,000 miles from Venice (1271) to the court of Kublai Khan in Shang-tu (Cathay).
Survive deserts, sickness, bandits, and starvation while keeping your caravan supplied.
If you arrive alive, you win — if not… well, history forgets you.

🛠️ Starting Out

You begin with:

300 jewels (money)

2 sets of clothes

30 arrows

5 bottles of balm/unguents

some food and oil (after initial trading)

no camels yet

At the port of Laiassus (Armenia) you must buy:

Camels (7–12 recommended)

Food (at least 8 sacks to reach Babylon)

Oil skins (at least 6 for desert cooking)

Barter carefully — camels can only carry a certain load!

🎯 Hunting Skill

Before departure, rank your crossbow ability:

Expert (boar at 300 paces)

Good (deer at 50 paces)

Poor (woodchuck at 5 paces)

Clumsy (occasionally shoot your own foot)

This affects your reaction time when shooting at bandits or animals.

📆 How the Game Plays

Time advances in 2-month segments.

Each segment:

You travel a random distance (40–140+ miles).

Supplies are consumed.

Random events occur:

Barter in villages.

Sickness or wounds.

Desert hardships (oil required).

Bandit attacks.

Food spoilage, floods, or storms.

🍽️ Eating

Each leg you choose how well to eat:

Well (less chance of sickness, cover more miles, uses more food)

Adequately (balanced)

Poorly (conserves food, higher sickness chance)

Running out of food? You may have to buy more at high prices or even eat a camel.
No camels left = slow death.

🏹 Hunting

Occasionally you’ll get a chance to hunt.

You must type the displayed word (SPLAT, SPRONG, TWACK, or ZUNK) quickly.

Faster and more accurate = more food gained.

Each hunt costs 15 arrows.

🏜️ Deserts

Persian, Lop, and Gobi deserts require oil for cooking.

If you have none, you risk sickness from raw food.

Deserts also trigger special hardships (sandstorms, bad water, lost camels).

⚔️ Bandits

Sometimes bandits attack!

You’ll play the crossbow mini-game (typing the word fast).

Good shooting can scare them off.

Poor shooting means:

Jewels stolen

Wounds

Or death

📋 Inventory

At any time, your caravan may have:

Jewels – for barter

Camels – carry supplies (but can get sick, lost, or sold)

Food sacks

Oil skins

Clothes (lose them, and locals get offended)

Balms/Unguent bottles (heal wounds, infections)

Arrows (needed for hunting and fighting)

Camels can carry only 3 sacks/skins each — overload means selling supplies.

🏆 Winning

If you reach 6,000 miles, you arrive at the court of Kublai Khan.

The Khan marvels you survived, but keeps you as an envoy for 21 years.

Congratulations — you win! 🎉

☠️ Losing

You may fail if:

You run out of food (and camels).

You die of wounds or sickness.

Bandits kill your party.

You collapse in the desert.
