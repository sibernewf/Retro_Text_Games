BOUNCE – Player Documentation
How to Play
To play, double-click run.bat in the game’s folder.
This will build and run the game, and keep the window open when it finishes.

You will see prompts in the console to set up your bouncing ball simulation.

Game Setup Prompts
Initial velocity (ft/s)

How fast the ball is thrown upward from the ground.

Example: 50 for a gentle throw, 200 for a rocket launch.

Coefficient (0..1)

Represents how “bouncy” the ball is.

A superball is about 0.85.

A beanbag might be 0.3.

Use values less than 1 or the ball will bounce forever!

Time increment Δt (seconds)

Controls how often the ball’s position is calculated.

Smaller values (e.g., 0.05) = smoother curve but more output.

Larger values (e.g., 0.2) = choppier curve but fewer columns.

Total seconds to plot

How long the simulation runs before stopping.

Default is 6 seconds — increase for higher throws.

Reading the Output
Vertical axis (left) shows height in feet.

Horizontal axis (right) shows time in seconds.

A small letter o marks the ball’s position at each time step.

Vertical tick marks (|) at the bottom show whole-second intervals.

Numbers under the tick marks show the elapsed time in seconds.

Tips for Best Results
Realistic superball: Try Initial velocity = 50, Coefficient = 0.85, Δt = 0.1.

Crazy bouncing: Use a high coefficient (e.g., 0.95) and big velocity — watch it hop for ages.

Quick drop: Set velocity low (e.g., 10) and coefficient very low (e.g., 0.2) to see it die out fast.

Fine detail: Reduce Δt to 0.05 to see more “frames” of motion.

Long play: If your ball still has life left at the end, increase “total seconds” to capture more bounces.

If you set coefficient to 0, the ball will stop dead on the first bounce.

If you set coefficient too close to 1, the ball will keep bouncing for a very long time — press Ctrl+C to quit early.

Quitting
At any prompt, type Q to quit the program.

In the middle of the simulation, close the console window or press Ctrl+C.

Here’s a small ASCII diagram you can drop straight into the Bounce Player Documentation so players instantly “get” how the output works.

How to read it:
 - The numbers on the left are height in feet.
 - The o marks where the ball is at each time step.
 - The bottom line is the time axis in seconds.
 - Vertical bars under the axis mark exact seconds.
