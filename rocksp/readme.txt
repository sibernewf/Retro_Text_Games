ROCKSP GAME OF ROCK, SCISSORS, PAPER

Description
Remember the game of rock-scissors-paper. You and your opponent
make a motion three times with your fists and then either show
a flat hand (paper), fist (rock), or two fingers (scissors).
Depending upon what is shown, the game is a tie (both show the
same) or one person wins. Paper wraps up rock, so it wins.
Scissors cut paper, so it wins. And rock breaks scissors,
so it wins.

In this computerized version of rock-scissors-paper, you can
play up to ten games vs. the computer.
