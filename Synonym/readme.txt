📘 Player Documentation – Synonm: Word Synonyms
🎮 How to Play

The computer chooses a word.

Your task: type a synonym (a word that has the same or nearly the same meaning).

If your synonym matches one in the program’s word list, you’ll receive a positive response such as RIGHT, CORRECT, or GOOD!.

If your answer is not in the list, the program will tell you TRY AGAIN.

If you cannot think of a synonym, type HELP. The computer will give you a synonym. You may ask for help more than once, but each time you’ll see a different synonym from the list until none remain.

📋 Example Play
WHAT IS A SYNONYM OF FIRST? START
CORRECT

WHAT IS A SYNONYM OF PIT? WELL
CHECK

WHAT IS A SYNONYM OF HOUSE? HOME
TRY AGAIN
WHAT IS A SYNONYM OF HOUSE? DWELLING
RIGHT

📚 Word Sets

The drill includes 10 groups of words, each with several synonyms. Examples:

FIRST → START, BEGINNING, INITIAL

SIMILAR → ALIKE, SAME, LIKE, RESEMBLING

MODEL → PROTOTYPE, PATTERN, STANDARD

HOUSE → DWELLING, RESIDENCE, HABITATION

RED → CRIMSON, FLAME, RUBY

🕹️ Ending the Drill

After all groups have been used, the program prints:
“SYNONYM DRILL COMPLETED.”

The game then ends.

💡 Tips

Spelling must match exactly (no partial words).

You may use uppercase or lowercase.

Some words have multiple synonyms — keep trying until you find one in the list.

Use HELP if stuck — but save it as a last resort!

▶️ To Play

Double-click run.bat in the game’s folder.
