✈️ Around the World Flight of Amelia Earhart (1937)
📖 Introduction

Step into the shoes of Amelia Earhart in her famous attempt to circumnavigate the globe in her twin-engine Lockheed Electra.
The year is 1937. Your goal: fly from Oakland, California, around the world, and return safely — making careful decisions about fuel, weather, maintenance, and your navigator’s condition.

This simulation challenges you to plan flights, survive mechanical failures, and adapt to unexpected events.

🛠️ Game Setup

You begin in Oakland, California on May 20, 1937.

Your plane, the Electra, holds up to 1150 gallons of fuel.

Ideal cruising speed: 150 mph.

Fuel efficiency: ~2.3 miles per gallon under ideal conditions (varies with weather, speed, and mechanical state).

🎮 How to Play

Each flight leg proceeds as follows:

Status Check

The program tells you:

Current date

Location

Airfield condition

Weather forecast

Your pilot condition

Navigator’s condition (⚠️ he has a drinking problem!)

Aircraft Maintenance

Minor malfunctions may appear (instruments, engine parts, hydraulics, etc.).

Decide whether to repair now (costs time) or risk continuing.

Every ~40 hours of flying, a major overhaul is recommended.

Flight Planning

Enter desired fuel load (max 1150 gallons).

Enter desired flying speed (between 120–170 mph).

Weather may encourage you to wait a day before flying.

Takeoff

Success depends on runway quality, weather, and load.

Failures (mud, monsoon, broken strut) may abort your flight.

In Flight

Weather may worsen (headwinds, monsoons, storms).

Engines may malfunction — you’ll have to decide whether to turn back, push on, or attempt a forced landing.

Fuel consumption is calculated — run out, and you’re forced down.

Navigation depends on your navigator’s sobriety and your equipment.

Landing

Contact control towers when possible.

Poor runway/weather conditions may lead to accidents.

Some airports (like Darwin) may impose delays.

⚠️ Special Events

Navigator Drunk: May be unusable after too much downtime.

Monsoons: Risk of being forced down, especially in Burma.

Instrument failures: Some legs (e.g., Java) may produce unavoidable setbacks.

Howland Island: The most dangerous leg — poor radio, long distance, low chance of success.

Japanese capture scenario: If you crash near the Marshall Islands, grim fate awaits.

🏆 Winning the Game

Complete the around-the-world route and return to Oakland safely.

You’ll be celebrated with CONGRATULATIONS! messages and cheering crowds.

❌ Losing the Game

You may fail by:

Crashing during takeoff.

Running out of fuel mid-flight.

Multiple malfunctions causing loss of control.

Being forced down in hostile or remote territory.

Poor planning (e.g., not enough maintenance, bad weather choices).

💡 Strategy Tips

Don’t overload with fuel unless necessary — heavy loads increase takeoff risk.

Plan maintenance — waiting too long leads to catastrophic failures.

Watch the navigator’s drinking — too many delays, and he becomes unreliable.

In poor weather, patience pays off — better to wait than crash.

The Pacific legs (Lae → Howland → Honolulu) are the most dangerous — load fuel carefully and manage risk.
