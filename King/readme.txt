Main Responsibilities Each Year
You will manage the national budget and make decisions about:

Selling Land to Industry
Industry buys land for strip mining at a fixed price per square mile.

Selling land increases industrial pollution but generates income.

Distributing Rallods to Citizens
 - Each citizen needs 100 Rallods/year to survive.
 - Underfeeding causes starvation and unrest.

Planting Crops
 - Farm costs vary between 10–15 Rallods/sq. mile.
 - Adequate crops feed your people and keep them happy.

Pollution Control Spending
 - Reduces the harmful effects of industrial pollution on health, wildlife, and tourism.

Random Events and Consequences
 - Population changes: Workers immigrate or emigrate based on opportunities, pollution, and quality of life.
 - Tourism income: Depends on pollution levels, environmental quality, and random fluctuations.

Pollution:
 - Air and water pollution reduce wildlife, ruin beaches, discourage tourists.
 - Extreme pollution can cause mass illness or death.

Civil unrest:
 - If too many people die from starvation or pollution, the population may revolt.

You can be impeached, overthrown, assassinated, or forced to resign.

Economic crises:
 - Insufficient reserves force land sales.
 - Bad budgeting can bankrupt the treasury.

Losing Conditions
 - Massive starvation or pollution deaths.
 - Treasury bankruptcy with civil unrest.
 - Being impeached, assassinated, or forced out of office.
 - National unrest leading to overthrow.

Winning Condition
Successfully complete 8 years in office.

Finish with a stable treasury, healthy population, and controlled pollution.

Receive the congratulatory message:

CONGRATULATIONS! YOU HAVE SUCCESSFULLY COMPLETED YOUR 8-YEAR TERM!

Tips for Survival
Balance land sales and environmental health.

Never underfeed citizens — unrest rises quickly.

Keep pollution under control to protect tourism income.

Always leave enough Rallods in the treasury for emergencies.

Watch for land planting capacity: Each citizen can only plant 2 sq. miles/year.
