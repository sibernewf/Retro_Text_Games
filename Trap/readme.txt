📘 Player Documentation – TRAP: Trap a Mystery Number
🎮 The Game

TRAP is a logic game where you try to catch the computer’s mystery number.

The computer picks a random number between 1 and 100.

You have 6 guesses to find it.

On each guess, you enter two numbers called trap numbers.

🕹️ How to Play

The computer announces:
“I am thinking of a number between 1 and 100.”

For each guess:

Enter two numbers (your trap numbers).

Example: 20 and 40.

The computer responds:

“MY NUMBER IS LARGER THAN YOUR TRAP NUMBERS.” → the mystery number is higher than both guesses.

“MY NUMBER IS SMALLER THAN YOUR TRAP NUMBERS.” → the mystery number is lower than both guesses.

“YOU HAVE TRAPPED MY NUMBER.” → the mystery number lies between your two guesses.

“YOU GOT IT!!!” → you guessed exactly right (both numbers equal the mystery number).

📋 Example Game
I AM THINKING OF A NUMBER BETWEEN 1 AND 100
TRY TO GUESS MY NUMBER.

GUESS #1
   First trap number: 30
   Second trap number: 50
YOU HAVE TRAPPED MY NUMBER.

GUESS #2
   First trap number: 42
   Second trap number: 42
YOU GOT IT!!!

🏆 Winning

To win, you must guess the exact number by entering it as both trap numbers (e.g., 42 and 42).

If you don’t guess it in 6 tries, you lose, and the computer reveals its number.

💡 Strategy Tips

Start with a wide range (like 1 and 100) to see where the number lies.

Narrow down with smaller ranges each turn.

Finish by guessing the same number twice to win.
