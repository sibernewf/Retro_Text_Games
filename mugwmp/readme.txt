MUGWMP ‚Äì FIND 4 MUGWUMPS IN HIDING

A deduction and triangulation challenge on a 10√ó10 grid.

üìú Objective

Your goal is to find the four Mugwumps hiding somewhere on a 10 by 10 coordinate grid.

The grid coordinates run:

X axis (horizontal): 0 (left) to 9 (right)

Y axis (vertical): 0 (bottom) to 9 (top)

The homebase is the bottom-left corner (0,0).

üó∫ The Setup

The computer randomly hides 4 Mugwumps, each on a different square.

You cannot see them ‚Äî your only clues are distances.

You have 10 turns to find them all.

üé≤ How to Play

Enter your guess as a coordinate pair:

X,Y


Example:

5,7


This means 5 units right and 7 units up from homebase.

After each guess:

If your guess matches a Mugwump‚Äôs exact location, you find that Mugwump.

If not, the computer tells you the straight-line distance from your guess to each Mugwump still hiding.

Use distances from multiple turns to triangulate their positions.

Distances are shown with one decimal place.

‚è± Turns & Winning

You have 10 turns total.

The game ends early if you find all 4 Mugwumps.

If you run out of turns, the computer reveals all hiding spots.

üí° Tips for Success

Use graph paper to plot guesses and distances.

After two guesses, you can draw possible circles for each Mugwump ‚Äî where those circles overlap is the hiding spot.

This is similar to LORAN or GPS triangulation.

üìö Commands

During the game prompt:

X,Y ‚Äì Make a guess (both numbers 0‚Äì9).

HELP ‚Äì Shows input instructions.

QUIT ‚Äì End the game immediately and reveal all Mugwumps.

üèÜ Scoring Ideas (optional if you want to track)

Perfect Score: Find all 4 in ‚â§ 6 turns.

Good: All found in ‚â§ 8 turns.

Okay: All found in ‚â§ 10 turns.

Try Again: Did not find all before time ran out.
