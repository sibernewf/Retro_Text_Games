üéÆ How to Play

Rolling the Dice

On your turn, the computer rolls 5 dice for you.

You may roll up to 3 times (initial roll + two re-rolls).

After the first or second roll, you may choose to re-roll some of the dice:

The program asks:
HOW MANY DO YOU WANT TO CHANGE?

Enter 0‚Äì5.

If >0, it will then ask WHICH?. Enter dice positions (1‚Äì5).

Those dice are re-rolled; the others stay.

Choosing a Category

After rolling, you must assign your dice to a scoring category:

Type the category name (e.g., FIVES, YAHTZEE, CHANCE).

Type SUMMARY to see which categories you‚Äôve already used and your current totals.

Type ZERO to scratch a category (score 0 in it).

Scoring Rules

Aces ‚Äì Count and add all 1‚Äôs.

Twos ‚Äì Count and add all 2‚Äôs.

Threes ‚Äì Count and add all 3‚Äôs.

Fours ‚Äì Count and add all 4‚Äôs.

Fives ‚Äì Count and add all 5‚Äôs.

Sixes ‚Äì Count and add all 6‚Äôs.

Three of a Kind ‚Äì If 3 dice the same, score the total of all 5 dice. Otherwise 0.

Four of a Kind ‚Äì If 4 dice the same, score the total of all 5 dice. Otherwise 0.

Full House ‚Äì 3 of one kind and 2 of another = 25 points.

Large Straight ‚Äì Sequence of 5 in a row (e.g., 1-2-3-4-5) = 40 points.

Yahtzee ‚Äì All 5 dice the same = 50 points.
