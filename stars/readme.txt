STARS – A Number Guessing Game
🎯 Objective

The computer will secretly choose a whole number from 1 to 100 (or another range set by the programmer).
Your goal is to guess the number within 7 tries.

🕹 How to Play

When the game starts, you’ll see a short set of instructions.

The computer chooses its secret number.

You enter your guess and press Enter.

The computer responds with a row of stars to tell you how close you are:

1 star (*) – You are far away from the number.

7 stars (*******) – You are extremely close.

Numbers in between mean you are getting warmer.

Use the star feedback to adjust your next guess.

If you guess correctly, the game tells you how many tries you needed.

If you don’t guess in 7 guesses, the game reveals the number.

⭐ Star Feedback System

The stars are based on how close your guess is to the secret number.

Fewer stars = very wrong, you’re far away.

More stars = very close, keep going!

Think of it as a “hot and cold” game, but with 1–7 stars instead of words.

💡 Strategy Tips

Your first guess should be somewhere near the middle of the range (e.g., 50 for 1–100).

After each guess, narrow the possible range based on the number of stars.

7 guesses means you can halve the search space each time for a guaranteed win if you play optimally.

🏆 Winning & Losing

Win: Guess the correct number in 7 or fewer tries.

Lose: Use all 7 guesses without finding the number. The secret number will be revealed.

🔄 Replay

After each game, you can choose to play again or quit.
The secret number changes every game.
