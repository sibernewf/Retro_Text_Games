WELCOME TO CHEMST — DILUTE KRYPTOCYANIC ACID SAFELY!
----------------------------------------------------
You have been given a dangerous chemical, Kryptocyanic Acid.
It must be diluted using EXACTLY 7 parts water to 3 parts acid.
For example: If you have 30 liters of acid,
Water needed = Acid × (7 ÷ 3)  →  30 × (7/3) = 70 liters.
Any other ratio will cause an unstable reaction and an explosion!
You have 9 lives. Being more than 5% off loses a life.
Practice mode is OFF.
