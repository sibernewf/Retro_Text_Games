KINEMA ‚Äî Throw a Ball Up in the Air
Overview
This game tests your basic kinematics knowledge.
The computer gives you a problem about a ball thrown straight up into the air at a given speed, and you must answer three questions about its motion.

You don‚Äôt have to be perfect ‚Äî if your answer is within 15% of the correct value, it counts as correct.

The Problem
A ball is thrown straight up at a random initial velocity (in meters per second).
You must calculate:

Maximum height the ball will reach (in meters).

Total time until the ball returns to the ground (in seconds).

Velocity of the ball after a randomly chosen time (in seconds).

How to Play
The game displays:

A BALL IS THROWN UPWARDS AT 21 METERS PER SECOND
You will then be asked three questions:

Example:

HOW HIGH WILL IT GO (IN METERS)? 
HOW LONG UNTIL IT RETURNS (IN SECONDS)?
WHAT WILL ITS VELOCITY BE AFTER 2.5 SECONDS?
Type your answers as numbers and press Enter.

The computer tells you if you were:

CORRECT! VERY GOOD!

CLOSE ENOUGH. (within 15%)

NOT EVEN CLOSE...

After all three questions, your score will be displayed:

sql
Copy
Edit
2 RIGHT OUT OF 3. NOT BAD.
You can choose to play another problem or quit.

Scoring
3/3 ‚Üí Excellent!

2/3 ‚Üí Good job.

1/3 or less ‚Üí You need more practice.

Physics Formulas Used (for reference)
Max Height: 

      ùëâ^2
H =   ____
     2 ^ g


Total Time: 


    2 ^ V
ùëá = _____
      g


Velocity after t seconds: 

ùëâ (sub)  t = V - g * t


ùëî = 9.8m/s ^ 2
(Gravity)
 

Tips
Remember gravity slows the ball going up at 9.8 m/s¬≤, and speeds it up the same amount coming down.

If you don‚Äôt know the exact answer, give your best estimate ‚Äî you might still be close enough.
