Modern Baseball – Player Documentation
Overview
Modern Baseball is a text-based baseball simulation game where you play as the manager of one team (the Away team) against the computer-controlled Home team.
You make batting decisions — swing, take, or bunt — and watch the play-by-play unfold.
The game tracks innings, outs, hits, walks, runs, and gives you a full scoreboard and commentary.

Starting the Game
 - Ensure you are in the game’s folder in your terminal or by double-clicking your batch file.
 - Run the included run.bat file.
   - This will automatically start the game using:

     dotnet run

Game Setup
When you start the game, you will be asked:
 - Away team name (you)
   - Type your team’s name and press Enter.
   - Press Q and Enter to quit immediately.
   - Leave blank to use the default name "Panthers".
 - Home team name (CPU)
   - Type the CPU team’s name and press Enter.
   - Press Q and Enter to quit immediately.

You’ll then see a tip on how to make choices during the game.

How to Play
The game is played in the standard 9 innings (with extra innings if tied).
You control your team’s offense (batting). The computer handles pitching and its own batting turns.

Your Turn at Bat
When your batter comes up, you will see something like:

  Count 1-1  Bases [1.3]  Outs 1 | Choose: [S]wing  [T]ake  [B]unt  [Q]uit:

 - Count → Balls-Strikes
 - Bases →
   - 1 means runner on 1st base
   - 2 means runner on 2nd base
   - 3 means runner on 3rd base
   - . means empty base
     Example: [1.3] means runners on 1st and 3rd.
 - Outs → Number of outs in the inning.

   - T → Take the pitch (chance it’s a ball or called strike).
   - B → Attempt a bunt (possible sacrifice, bunt hit, foul, or out).
   - Q → Quit the game immediately.

Game Flow
 - Each half-inning continues until your team or the CPU gets 3 outs.

Example
*** MODERN BASEBALL ***

Away team name (you) or 'Q' to quit: Panthers
Home team name (CPU) or 'Q' to quit: Rockets

Tip: During your at-bats choose S (swing), T (take), B (bunt), or Q (quit).

Welcome to Rockets Stadium — Panthers vs Rockets


=== Top 1 — Panthers 0 — Rockets 0 ===

↑ Panthers — Batter #1  [..3]  Outs:0
Count 0-0  Bases [..3]  Outs 0 | Choose: [S]wing  [T]ake  [B]unt  [Q]uit: S
Line drive — single.

Tips
 - Swing when ahead in the count or when you need a big hit.
 - Take when the pitcher is wild — walks can push in runs.
 - Bunt with a fast runner and less than 2 outs to advance runners.
 - Keep an eye on outs and base runners before choosing your move.

Outcomes (what they mean & what happens)
When you Take (don’t swing)
 - “Taken for a ball.” → Count balls +1. Walk at 4 balls (see Walk below).
 - “Taken for a strike.” → Count strikes +1. Strikeout looking at 3 strikes → OUT.

When you Swing
 - “HOMER! N run(s) score.”
   - Batter and all runners score. Bases cleared.
 - “Triple off the wall!”
   - Batter to 3rd. All runners advance 3 bases and may score.
 - “Drilled to the gap — double.”
   - Batter to 2nd. Runners advance 2 bases (scores possible).
 - “Line drive — single.”
   - Batter to 1st. Runners advance 1 base (runner on 2nd often scores if forced ahead).
 - “Close pitch — called ball.”
   - Rare ball on a swing decision (count balls +1). Walk at 4.
 - “Swing and a miss — strike.”
   - Count strikes +1. At 3 strikes → “…strike three!” → OUT.
 - Ball in play outs
   - “Hard grounder — double play!”
      - With runner on 1st and ≤1 out, likely 6-4-3 DP: two outs, bases update.
   - “Chopper to short — out at first.”
      - Batter out, runners hold/advance on force only.
   - “Fly ball — caught.”
      - Batter out, runners hold (no tags in this simplified model).

When you Bunt
 - “Perfect bunt — infield single.”
    - Batter safe at 1st, runners advance 1.
 - “Good sacrifice — runner(s) advance, batter out.”
   - Runners +1 base, batter OUT.
 - “Bunt attempt goes foul — strike.”
   - Counts as a strike; strike three → OUT.
 - “Popped up the bunt — OUT.”
   - Batter out, runners hold.

Walks
 - “Batter walks.” at 4 balls.
 - Bases loaded → “Walk forces in a run! +1” (or more if multiple forced).

Score, Innings, and End Conditions
 - Half-inning ends at 3 outs; bases reset.
 - 9 innings regulation. If tied after 9, extra innings continue until a winner emerges.
 - Final line shows: AWAY X — HOME Y. Full play-by-play saved to bb_playbyplay.txt.

CPU Behavior (so you can game the AI a bit 😏)
 - With <2 outs and only a runner on 1st: ~20% chance to Bunt.
 - Otherwise: ~70% Swing, ~30% Take.
 - Being ahead in the count improves hit odds; behind favors strikeouts/outs.

Base & Force Rules (simplified)
 - Advance(n) moves all runners n bases in order (3rd → home first).
 - Walk forces runners if bases behind are occupied (can score a run).
 - Double Play most likely on grounder with runner on 1st and ≤1 out.
 - No steals, tags, or infield fly—kept intentionally simple for flow.

Reading the Bases Display
 - [1..] → runner on 1st only
 - [..3] → runner on 3rd only
 - [123] → bases loaded
 - [...] → bases empty

Tips for Winning
 - Take more often when you’re ahead in the count or the pitcher’s wild; free baserunners win games.
 - Bunt with a runner on 1st and 0–1 outs to avoid double plays and move them into scoring position.
 - Swing when you need an RBI or with runners on 2nd/3rd and 2 outs.
