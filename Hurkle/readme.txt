HURKLE — Player Instructions
Overview
A shy Hurkle is hiding somewhere on a 10 × 10 grid.
Your mission is to find the Hurkle within 5 guesses.
After each guess, you will be told the approximate direction to search next.

The Grid
The grid has coordinates from 0 to 9 on both X (East-West) and Y (North-South) axes.

(0,0) is the Homebase, located in the southwest corner.

Coordinates are written as X,Y — for example, 7,3 means:

X = 7 → 7 steps east from Homebase

Y = 3 → 3 steps north from Homebase

How to Play
The computer secretly hides the Hurkle at a random gridpoint.

You enter guesses in the format:
X,Y

  Example: 4,5 means 4 east, 5 north.

The game tells you the direction from your guess to the Hurkle:

GO NORTH

GO EAST

GO SOUTHEAST

GO NORTHWEST

You adjust your next guess based on the hint.

You have five guesses to find the Hurkle.

Winning
If your guess exactly matches the Hurkle's location, you win:

  YOU FOUND HIM IN 3 GUESSES!
Losing

If you fail after 5 guesses, the Hurkle reveals itself:

  SORRY, THAT'S 5 GUESSES.
  THE HURKLE IS AT X,Y.

Example Round

A HURKLE IS HIDING ON A 10 BY 10 GRID.
HOMEBASE IS POINT 0,0 IN THE SOUTHWEST CORNER.

GUESS #1 ? 4,5
GO SOUTHEAST

GUESS #2 ? 7,2
GO NORTHWEST

GUESS #3 ? 6,3
YOU FOUND HIM IN 3 GUESSES!
Tips
Use each hint to narrow down possible Hurkle locations.

If the game says NORTHEAST, increase X and Y.

If it says SOUTHWEST, decrease both X and Y.

Remember: The Hurkle won’t move between guesses.
