You will see the distance remaining to the hole.

Choose a club number.

The computer will simulate your shot.

If you land in the rough, you can still play normally.

If you land in a sand trap, shots are harder to control.

If you land in water, you lose a stroke and the ball is replaced on the fairway.

If you are on the green, choose the putter to finish the hole.

Continue until the ball is in the hole.

Scoring is strokes taken for each hole.

Special Events
Duffed Shot – Very short distance.

Hole in One – Rare but possible.

Water Hazard – Lose 1 stroke.
