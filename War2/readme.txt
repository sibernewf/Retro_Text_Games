üìò Player Documentation ‚Äì WAR¬∑2: Troop Tactics in War
üéÆ The Game

This is a tongue-in-cheek war simulation. You and the computer each have 72,000 troops, which must be divided among:

Army

Navy

Air Force

You then take turns attacking with part of your forces. After two battles, the outcome is decided.

üïπÔ∏è How to Play

At the start, distribute your 72,000 troops into Army, Navy, and Air Force.

Example:

HOW MANY TROOPS FOR ARMY? 30000
HOW MANY TROOPS FOR NAVY? 20000
HOW MANY TROOPS FOR AIR FORCE? 22000


The computer does the same.

You then choose your attack:

WHAT IS YOUR NEXT MOVE? ARMY=1, NAVY=2, AIR FORCE=3
HOW MANY MEN?


The program reports the outcome (e.g., destroyed ships, lost planes, wiped bases).

After two battles, the final outcome is declared.

üìã Example Run

HOW MANY MEN? 2000
YOU SUNK 1000 OF MY PATROL BOATS.
