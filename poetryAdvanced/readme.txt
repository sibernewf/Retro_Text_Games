POETRY – Random Poetry Generator

Objective:
Generates a short poem by randomly selecting lines from a set of 23 prewritten phrases.
Each run will produce different combinations, spacing lines at random intervals.
The output ends at roughly the same point each time, with little chance of duplicate lines.

How to Play:

Run the program.

The computer will automatically output a randomly generated poem.

No input is required; just enjoy the unpredictable verses.

Tips:

Try running multiple times to see the variety in structure and line choice.

You can edit the source code to add your own lines for personalized poems.

POET – Random Haiku-Style Poetry Generator

Objective:
Produces free-form poetry inspired by Haiku. The program cycles through 20 preset phrases arranged into four groups of five.
It adds random commas, indentations, and paragraph breaks for a more organic feel.

How to Play:

Run the program.

Read and enjoy the continuous stream of verses.

There’s no player interaction—the fun is in the unexpected combinations.

Special Features:

Random punctuation and line breaks make each poem unique.

Paragraph breaks occur randomly (18% chance per phrase, but guaranteed at least every 20 phrases).

Phrases are Poe-inspired by default, but you can replace them with lines from any theme (nature, romance, technology, etc.).


How to steer the style
Add more words (with syllable counts and a rhyme key when you want them usable as line-end rhymes).
The more vocabulary you add, the richer (and more coherent) the verse.

Adjust templates in Templates to change sentence shapes.

Turn alliteration on/off from the menu (it selects a letter for many of a line’s content words).

Change stanza targets (e.g., use 9–11 syllables for a heavier couplet).
