Tour de France Bicycle Race

(c) David H. Ahl, 1986 — C# Conversion)

📖 Introduction

You are a bicycle racer entered in the 22-day Tour de France. Your goal is to win the race by having the lowest overall elapsed time across all stages. You can also compete for stage wins and the overall points prize.

Each day is one stage of the Tour. At the end, you’ll see who won the stage, who is leading overall, and eventually the race summary.

🎯 Objectives

Finish all 22 stages of the Tour de France.

Win as many stages as possible by sprinting effectively at the end.

Manage your fitness, gear ratios, hazards, and stamina to reduce delays.

Aim to finish with the lowest overall time and become the Tour champion!

🕹️ Controls

Pedaling:

You will assign two keys (left and right pedal).

Press them alternately as fast as possible to increase your RPM.

Alternatively, let the computer pedal for you (based on your fitness & random factors).

Gear Selection:

Choose between front ring (40 or 52 teeth) and cogs (13, 15, 17, 19, 21, 23, 25).

Gear ratios affect performance on flat, hilly, or mountainous stages.

A poor gear choice may slow you down.

Sprinting:

In the last 10 km of each stage, you can trigger a sprint at any time.

Starting too early may cause exhaustion.

Starting too late may allow others to overtake.

Yes/No Decisions:

Repairs, crashes, and some physical issues require player input.

Enter Y or N when prompted.

🧮 Gameplay Mechanics

Fitness:

Determined by your health level and how many weeks you practice before the Tour.

Better fitness increases your pedaling efficiency.

Hazards:

Road hazards (wind, mud, weather) may delay you.

Mechanical breakdowns (flat tires, broken chain, etc.) will cost time.

Physical problems (cramps, injuries, collapse) may force slower pacing or even withdrawal.

Rest Days:

Some stages are rest days. Use them to recover, but be aware your navigator (if drunk in other games; here, it’s just you) doesn’t need rest—only your rider’s stamina is tracked.

Stage Results:

After each stage, times for all 6 riders are calculated.

A stage winner is announced, and cumulative times are updated.

Race End:

After Stage 22, the computer announces:

Stage Winner Count (most daily wins)

Overall Winner (fastest time)

Points Winner (best combo of stage wins & time)

⚠️ Hazards & Events

Road Conditions: gravel, mud, tailwind, headwind, icy rain, clear day.

Mechanical Failures: flat tire, broken chain, gear issues, crash.

Physical Issues: cramps, shin splints, altitude sickness, exhaustion.

Any of these may delay you by fractions of an hour — or force you to abandon the race.

🏆 Winning Conditions

Overall Champion: Lowest total elapsed time across all stages.

Stage Wins: Winning individual stages adds prestige and points.

Points Winner: Combination of fastest times and most stage victories.

🔑 Tips & Strategy

Practice at least 6+ weeks before the Tour for a strong fitness base.

Choose gears wisely depending on stage type:

Low ratio (40/25) → Mountains.

High ratio (52/13) → Flat terrain.

Don’t sprint too early — save energy for the final kilometers.

Repair mechanical issues early; delaying can cost more later.

Balance effort: pushing too hard risks collapse, but being too conservative loses time.

📌 Notes

The game uses your keyboard speed (pedaling keys) or simulated RPM to calculate race pace.

Some hazards and breakdowns are random. No two playthroughs are exactly alike.

If you abandon or crash, the game ends early.
