SPLAT – Open a Parachute at the Last Moment
Objective

Survive a parachute jump by opening your chute at the last possible safe moment.
Wait too long and you’ll go SPLAT. Open too early and you’ll be safe, but your bravery score will suffer.

How the Game Works

You will either:

Select your own terminal velocity (speed at which you stop accelerating in free fall),
OR let the computer assign one.

Select your own acceleration due to gravity,
OR let the computer assign one, which may put you on:

One of the 8 planets (out to Neptune)

The Moon

The Sun

The game will:

Tell you the height of your jump.

Ask how many seconds of free fall you plan before opening your chute.

The jump is divided into 8 time intervals, showing your altitude after each.

If you survive, your performance is compared to all previous successful jumps recorded in the PARACH.UTE file.

You’ll be ranked based on how close to the ground you were before opening the chute.

Controls

Y / N – Yes or No to setup questions.

Numeric Input – Enter your chosen values for:

Terminal Velocity (if selecting yourself)

Acceleration (if selecting yourself)

Free fall time in seconds

Return – Accept defaults or proceed.

Winning & Losing

Win: Open your chute before hitting the ground.

Lose: Wait too long — you’ll see SPLAT and a poetic epitaph.

Rankings are based on bravery:

Lower chute-opening height → higher ranking.

Tied heights → earlier players keep higher rank.

Scoring

Conservative Jump – Open early, survive, but rank lower.

Brave Jump – Open late, survive, rank higher.

SPLAT – No points, but possible witty in-game message.

Replayability

Multiple planetary settings change gravity & terminal velocity.

Long-term high-score table keeps track of the best jumps.

System Requirements

Works in any .NET-capable environment with a console.

No external libraries needed.
