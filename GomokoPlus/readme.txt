GomokoPlus – Player Guide
Overview
GomokoPlus is an enhanced console version of the traditional Japanese game Gomoko (also called Five-in-a-Row).
Two players — you (X) and the computer (O) — take turns placing markers on a grid.
The first to get five in a row horizontally, vertically, or diagonally wins.

Game Start
You will be greeted with a welcome message and instructions.

The board is empty at the start.

You always play first as X.

Board Layout
The board is a 19 × 19 grid of dots (.) showing empty spaces.

The top and left edges have numbers so you can identify grid coordinates.

Example (truncated board):
    1  2  3  4  5
 1  .  .  .  .  .
 2  .  .  .  .  .
 3  .  .  .  .  .

Controls
Placing a Marker

On your turn, enter the row number and then the column number.
Example: entering 5 7 places your marker in row 5, column 7.

Quit the Game

At any time, type Q (uppercase or lowercase) to end the game immediately.

Rules
Players alternate turns:

You place an X.

The computer places an O.

The first to get five consecutive markers in any straight line wins.

No overwriting: You cannot place a marker where one already exists.

If the board fills without a winner, the game ends in a draw.

Winning & Losing
If you align five X markers in a row → You win!

If the computer aligns five O markers in a row → Computer wins!

The game announces the winner immediately and offers to play again.

Example Turn:

Your move (row col or Q to quit): 10 10
You placed an X at (10,10).
Computer placed an O at (5,5).

Tips for Winning
Block your opponent’s four-in-a-row before it becomes five.

Try to create multiple lines at once so blocking you is harder.

Play near the center for more options.
