🐂 Player Guide — Westward Ho! 1847
🎯 Goal

Lead your family from Independence, Missouri to Oregon City—2,040 miles—without perishing from hunger, exposure, injuries, or bandits.

💰 Starting Setup

You’ve saved $420 and already bought a wagon for $70, leaving $350 to spend on:

Oxen — pay more for a stronger, faster team (affects travel speed).

Food — needed every segment.

Ammunition — $1 at start buys 50 bullets (used for hunting & fights).

Clothes — crucial for cold weather in the mountains.

Other supplies — medicine, first-aid, tools, spare parts.

You can also save cash to buy more at forts later (but prices are worse).

⏱️ Game Flow

Time advances in 2-week segments (up to 20 segments).

Each segment:

Date & location update (“You are near …”).

Travel miles added based on oxen cost and luck.

Inventory shown (Cash, Food, Ammo, Clothes, Medicine/parts).

Choose to stop at a fort, hunt, or push on (options vary by segment).

Choose how well to eat (consumes food, affects health).

Possible riders (friendly/hostile).

Random hazards/events (breakdowns, storms, bites, bandits, etc.).

Mountains section (South Pass, Blue Mountains, blizzards).

🍽️ Eating

Choose each segment:

Poorly (least food, higher illness chance)

Moderately

Well (most food, better health)

If Food < 5 at the start of eating, you’ll starve.

🏹 Hunting

Costs time and bullets (need ≥ 40 bullets).

Play the typing mini-game: quickly type one of POW, BANG, BLAM, WHOP (case-insensitive).

Faster = better results → more food, fewer bullets used.

If you miss, you gain no food.

🏇 Riders (Ambush or Not?)

You may encounter riders that might be hostile (or flip unexpectedly).

Options: Run, Attack, Ignore, Circle wagons.

Fighting uses ammo and triggers the typing mini-game. Slow reactions can cause injuries.

🧭 Forts

Every other segment you may stop at a fort to spend cash on:

Food, Ammo, Clothes, Medicine/parts.

Fort goods are expensive: e.g., ammo is 33 bullets/$ and most other items yield only ~67¢ value per $.

🏔️ Mountains

After ~975 miles, expect:

Slow going, getting lost, cave-ins (lose time/supplies).

South Pass and Blue Mountains can trigger blizzards.

Clothing is vital in cold—too little often leads to illness.

💊 Illness & Injury

Poor eating and cold increase illness risk.

Without medicine or cash for a doctor, illness/injury can be fatal.

🏁 Winning

Reach 2,040 miles alive.
You arrive exhausted but victorious in Oregon City!

☠️ Losing

You can die from:

Starvation (ran out of food)

Poison (snake bite without medicine)

Injuries/illness (no medicine/doctor)

Massacre (riders when out of ammo)

Exhaustion (oxen worn out; blizzards)

A somber epilogue reports your time on trail and supplies left.

🎮 Controls & Tips

Enter numbers for menus; Y/N when prompted.

Hunt early when you have ammo to build a food buffer.

Don’t overspend on oxen, but $150 is a solid, honest team.

Keep at least some cash for forts and emergencies.

Maintain clothes before the mountains; blizzards are brutal.

Save ammo for riders—running out can be fatal.
