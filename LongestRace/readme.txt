🚗 Player Guide — The Longest Automobile Race, 1908
🎯 Goal

Captain the Thomas Flyer from New York to Paris (east→west) faster than the competition. The race starts Feb 12, 1908. Reach Paris (leg 20) before September and, ideally, ahead of the race leader’s clock.

🧭 Route & Segments

The route is divided into 20 legs (cities).

For each leg you’ll see:

Location and your cash.

Road and weather forecast for the next stretch.

Your target miles and leader’s expected days for that leg.

You then choose Fuel, Speed, and Daily Driving Hours.

Travel advances day by day within the leg until you hit the target miles.

⛽ Fuel & Costs

Fuel price varies every leg (~$0.25/gal ± 30%).

Buy just enough for the coming segment (unused stays in your tank).

If you run out on the road, you’ll have to buy at a worse anchor price.

🛠️ Car & Pace Choices
Speed (mph)

8–54 mph allowed.

Bad weather/roads may cap practical speed (>30 mph disallowed when conditions are poor).

Higher speed increases breakdown chance.

Driving Hours / Day

2–8 hours allowed.

Sustained high hours raises fatigue/accident risk.

If you’ve averaged >~7.5h/day, you’ll get a warning.

🌦️ Weather & Roads

Weather each day adjusts your speed factor (PW):

Blizzard/Snow: slow or stuck (may pay a farmer to pull you out, or spend days doing it yourself).

Rain/Mud: chance to get bogged down.

Cloudy/Mixed/Sunny: normal days, but you can hit a river with no bridge—pay locals for a boat or lose days detouring to a bridge.

Road descriptions hint at general difficulty beyond the weather.

🔧 Breakdowns

Based on speed, you may suffer a mechanical failure (e.g., tire, clutch, axle, transmission).

Options:

Nurse it along (60% success). On success your speed is halved for a while; on failure you’re done for that leg run.

Fix option A (time + cost)

Fix option B (if available; different time/cost)

Repairs may take hours (possibly costing a day) or full days; you also pay hotel/meals ($10/day).

😴 Fatigue & Accidents

If you push hours, you may doze off and crash:

Tree / off-road / hole / wagon → time lost and repair cost or tow + repair.

If you refuse/ can’t pay, locals may impound your car → game over.

🚂 Railroad Ties (select regions)

In some legs, you can choose to drive along railroad tracks:

Faster progress, but higher breakdown chance.

🧴 “No Grease” (central Russia)

Sometimes there’s no grease; you can buy Vaseline for $4 or cut speed in half.

🚢 Ocean Legs

Multiple port waits and steamers/freighters (Seattle ⇄ Valdez, Japan, Vladivostok).

You’ll spend days in port and days at sea; sometimes you must return (e.g., Alaska route dead-end).

💵 Money & Telegraphs

If you can’t pay bills (fuel/repairs/hotel), send a telegram to Mr. Thomas for funds.

He responds better to messages that are:

POLITE (“PLEASE”, “BEG”, “SORRY”, “IMPORTANT”…)

URGENT (“SOON”, “QUICK”, “EARLY”, “FAST”, “HURRY”, “IMMEDIATELY”, “ONCE”, “URGENT”…)

Outcomes:

Polite+Urgent → $1000 (first requests), later $500.

Polite only → money after 3-day delay.

Urgent only → half the usual amount + scolding.

Neither / too short → no money.

After too many requests, he cuts you off.

🏁 Winning & Losing

Win / Place / Tie determined when you reach Paris (leg 20):

Ahead of leader days → You win!

Equal → Dead tie.

Behind → You still finished—honorable!

Lose if:

You run out of money and can’t eat/pay bills.

You’re impounded for unpaid tow/repairs.

You fail a key nursing attempt and cannot continue.

It’s September 1 (race is effectively over).

💡 Tips

Don’t overbuy fuel early; buy for the leg plus a bit of buffer.

Moderate speed avoids constant breakdowns; use higher speed only when conditions are good.

Keep hours/day sane—fatigue accidents cost more than they save.

Carry enough cash to handle repairs and hotel days on delays.

Be polite and urgent in telegraphs; keep them UPPER CASE and at least a sentence long.

Good luck, captain—see you on the Boulevard des Invalides in Paris! 🏆
