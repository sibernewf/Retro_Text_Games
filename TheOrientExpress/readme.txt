🎩 The Orient Express, 1923
📖 Scenario

It is February 1923. You are a British agent, sent aboard the legendary Orient Express. Your mission:

Identify the defector (the one who will betray his fellow arms dealers in exchange for safety and Scotch).

Unmask the killer (the dealer in machine guns who plans to silence the defector).

Deliver both safely to the Turkish police before the train reaches Uzunkopru, Turkey.

The train departs from London, England, and your journey will take you across Europe to Constantinople. Along the way, you must manage your time, endure hazards, and gather enough clues from conversations, meals, and events to correctly solve the mystery.
