HELLO – Converse with a Computer
(Adapted from Digital Equipment Corp., Maynard MA)

To play
To play, double-click run.bat in the game’s folder.
This will build and run the game, and keep the window open when it finishes.

Description
This is a light-hearted conversational program where you “chat” with the computer — in this case, a self-styled advice-giving personality named Petey P. Eight. Petey will ask about your mood, then offer (sometimes questionable) advice on your problems in one of four categories:

SEX

HEALTH

MONEY

JOB

The program is meant for entertainment, not serious guidance. Expect jokes, sarcasm, and the occasional absurd suggestion.

How to Play
Start the Program
Launch the game via run.bat.

Introduce Yourself

Petey will greet you and ask for your name.

Type your name and press Enter.

Answer Questions

Petey will ask whether you’re enjoying yourself and other YES/NO questions.

Type YES or NO (or just Y / N) and press Enter.

If you don’t answer with YES or NO, Petey will ask you again.

Choose a Problem Category

When prompted, type one of: SEX, HEALTH, MONEY, or JOB.

You may need to answer follow-up questions within that topic.

Receive Advice

Petey will give humorous “solutions” to your problem.

Continue or Quit

After each solution, Petey will ask if you have more problems.

Answer YES to choose another category, or NO to end the conversation.

Pay Your “Bill”

At the end, Petey will jokingly request $5.00 for the advice.

Whether you “pay” is up to you (your answer affects the closing comments).

Special Commands
Q at any prompt — instantly quits the program.

Tips
This is a parody program — don’t expect serious answers.

Experiment with different categories and answers to see all the humorous responses.

Try giving unexpected answers to see how Petey reacts.
