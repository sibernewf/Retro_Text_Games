Description
In BULL, you take on the role of the matador—the main star of the bullfight, tasked with defeating the bull or meeting a gory end. The challenge is to survive the passes of the bull, choose your cape maneuvers wisely, and decide the right moment to attempt the kill.

Game Flow
Instructions Prompt – At the start, you can choose to read the instructions (YES) or skip them (NO).

Bull Quality – The game randomly assigns you a bull’s quality (e.g., Superb, Good, Poor), which influences difficulty.

Picadores & Toreadores – The performance of your assisting team affects your chances.

Passes – Each turn (or “pass”), you choose your action:

0 – Veronica (dangerous inside move of the cape)

1 – Less dangerous outside move

2 – Ordinary swirl of the cape

Attempt to Kill the Bull – On any pass, you may try to kill the bull:

4 – Over the horns

5 – In the chest
(Pro tip: Don’t try before the seventh pass if you value your life.)

Scoring & Outcomes
Survival – The primary goal is to remain alive.

Awards – Based on your bravery, skill, and survival, the crowd may award you:

An ear of the bull

Two ears

Ovations or boos

Death – If the bull gores you, you die, and the award is given posthumously.

Tips
The braver the move, the higher the potential reward—but also the higher the risk.

A strong team of Picadores and Toreadores improves your odds.

Pay attention to the pass number before attempting the kill.

Sample Gameplay
Good Bull + Good Team → Safer early passes, better kill chances.

Poor Bull + Poor Team → Higher risk, especially if the bull survives many passes.
