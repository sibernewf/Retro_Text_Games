CHIEF – Arithmetic Practice
Author: John Graham
Category: Educational / Math Puzzle Game

Overview
CHIEF is a math-based game designed to give players (especially kids) fun practice with the four basic operations:

Addition

Subtraction

Multiplication

Division

You are challenged by Chief Numbers Freek, the "Great Indian Math God," to complete a short number puzzle.
The game also teaches you how to find the correct answer if you’re wrong.

Although intended for entertainment, it can also be used by teachers as a quick test tool for students.

Objective
Follow the Chief’s mathematical instructions exactly.

Try to predict the number he’s thinking of based on your calculation.

If you refuse or get it wrong, prepare for the Chief’s “lightning bolt”!

How to Play
Start the game
The Chief greets you and asks:

"ARE YOU READY TO TAKE THE TEST YOU CALLED ME OUT FOR?"

Respond

Type YES to play.

Any other answer ends the game immediately.

First Number Puzzle

The Chief instructs:

Take a number and add 3.

Divide this number by 5.

Multiply by 8.

Divide by 5 and add the same number again.

Subtract 1.

Enter your result when prompted.

The Chief’s Guess

He will guess your original number.

If he’s wrong, he asks for your original number and shows how the math works.

Lightning Bolt Sequence

If you disagree again, the Chief gets angry and draws a lightning bolt on the screen.

Scoring & Lives
This is a practice game — there’s no score or life system.

The fun is in seeing whether the Chief can predict your number.

Educational Use
Teachers can use this as a quick arithmetic exercise.

It encourages players to follow a multi-step calculation carefully.

Incorrect answers lead to a demonstration of the correct steps.

Example Round
Chief: "Take a number and add 3, divide by 5, multiply by 8, divide by 5 and add the same number again, subtract 1. What do you have?"
Player: 38
Chief: "I bet your number was 3.625 – was I right?"
Player: NO
Chief: "What was your original number?"
Player: 12
Chief: Shows step-by-step calculation, then asks if you believe him.

Notes
The game is meant for fun learning; the “angry lightning bolt” ending is just a text-art joke.

Works best in a classroom or casual play setting.
